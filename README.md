# Backend & Full Stack Projects


Here are the links to some of my Backend and FullStack projects:

1. [Azure AI Semantic Search](https://github.com/edward232232/Azure-AI-Semantic-Search)
   - A simple full-stack application developed using React for the frontend and Python for the backend. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in creating       a full-stack application that integrates with a cloud service on the backend. Specifically, this application uses Azure Search backend on the cloud to conduct semantic           search and full-text search for comparison.

      + **Tech Stack:** JavaScript/Typescript, React, Python, Azure, Azure AI Search
